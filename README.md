Intro
=====

Project for testing different OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering techniques and their performance
on mobile devices. This application is currently developed and being ran on Samsung Galaxy S2 only.
Also there is rather heavy development ongoing and big structural changes will occur from time
to time. This will last until somewhat good ratio between code flexibility and readibility is found.
Main purpose is to implement backbone for testing environment which can be extended later on.
